# SikuliXTest-01

Pros:

Sikuli is a visual technology to automate graphical user interfaces (GUI) using images (screenshots). 
Sikuli Script automates anything you see on the screen without internal API's support.

Cons:

macOS: new security restrictions
With the latest macOS versions, Apple has raised the security fences more and more. Especially the SikuliX features screenshot and mouse/keybord usage are now restricted and have to be unlocked in the SystemPreferences (more info here) Until a more general solution is available, you have to run SikuliX from a Terminal window: java -jar sikulix....jar

Support for Android device access paused
This feature has to be used as is. In case of problems you might post an issue, but support and development is paused until further notice.

JavaScript support paused
The anyways experimental support for JavaScript is currently switched off, since beginning with Java 15 the JavaScript engine is no longer included in Java. Ideas and suggestions, how to proceed with that are welcome.
